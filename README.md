# 🐱 Meow Meals

**Meow Meals** is a lightweight Minecraft mod for **Fabric 1.21** that adds new custom **cat-only foods** to the game!  
No more boring raw cod—pamper your cats with delicious meals crafted just for them. 🐟🥩✨

All item textures were hand-drawn using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/), and the mod was proudly built with [Fabric Kotlin](https://fabricmc.net/) ❤️

This mod was originally created for the [Hackclub Hackcraft Event](https://hackcraft.hackclub.com/)!  
Huge thanks to the Hackclub team for inspiring me to make something purr-fect 🐾
